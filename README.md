# Problem Description
You want to keep track of the pieces of art (series, movies, books) that you consume. You
are cringingly self-conscious about your productivity. So, you need to keep a ledger for all
the time you spend doing this. When you run the program, it will be able to accept
command line inputs. And, will show the result in the command line. When engaging with
the command line, it will give you options to
### 1. Add a consumable
a. There will be 3 types. Books, series, or movie. You will
have to choose one.
b. It should have this information
i. Name
ii. Consumption starting date in the format YYYY-MM-DD
(could be blank)
iii. Consumption ending date in the same format (could be
blank)
iv. Total consumption time in hours (will be 0 by default
at first)
v. Your personal rating X.YZ out of 10 (could be blank)
vi. Total days of consumption (will be 0 by default at
first)
### 2. Edit a consumable
a. When a product is being edited. You will have the option to
add a time in hrs which will be added to the total
consumption time.
b. While adding consumption time you will have an option to add
a day to days of consumption.
c. You can change the rating.
d. You can also add the consumption ending date. But, once
added, the consumable can not be edited anymore.
### 3. Delete a consumable
a. When a consumable is deleted, it will not show in the list
but the times and days added because of it will still be
there in total consumption time and days.
### 4. See the list of consumables and individually
a. If you choose a specific type, the list will include the
name of the consumable, total days of consumption, total hrsof consumption, rating. Showing these in a tabular form is
not mandatory. But, anyone would love that, right?
b. You can pick one and see the full details.
### 5. See overall info
a. The total consumption time in hours across all types
b. Individual consumption time in hours of each type
c. The total days of consumption across all types
d. Individual days of consumption of each type
e. Average rating across all types
f. Average individual rating of each type
g. Total number of consumable across all types
h. Individual number of consumable of each type
After creating the application, assume you have nothing at the moment. Then add 10
consumables with at least 2 from each type. Edit some of them so that the overall info can
be produced visibly.
